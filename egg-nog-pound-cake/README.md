# Eggnog Pound Cake
Note: came out a bit dry
## Ingredients
### Wet Team
- ½ cup softened butter
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 large eggs
- 1 ¼ cups eggnog
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
 
### Dry Team
- 2 ¼ cups all purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
- 3 ½ tsp baking powder sifted to remove lumps
- 1 tsp kosher salt

## Instructions
1.Brush your pans with softened or melted butter and dust lightly with flour. If you are using nonstick pans, you can either butter and flour them or use pan spray, or cupcake liners for muffin tins. See recipe note for recommended pans. Preheat the oven to 350 ℉.
1.Cream the softened butter until it is light in color and fluffy, then drizzle in the vegetable oil and continue to whip until combined.
1.Combine all dry ingredients in a small to medium mixing bowl, whisk well to combine, and set aside.
1.Break the eggs individually into a small bowl (in case there are bits of shell) and then, with the mixer running, whip them into the butter one at a time until the mixture is emulsified and uniform.
1.Add the vanilla to the eggnog and mix just to combine, then add about one third of the eggnog to the egg and butter mixture. It will separate a bit, but this is ok. It will come together in the next step… just make sure there aren't any large lumps.
1.Then, add the dry ingredients in thirds, alternating with the remaining eggnog, folding or mixing the batter lightly on low speed and stopping to scrape the bowl between the additions. Mix just until the batter is well-combined.
1.Pour or scoop the batter into your prepared pans, and bake until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean and the middle of the cake is set and golden brown.
1.Let cool for a few minutes in the pans, and when they are just cool enough to handle, turn them out onto a wire rack to finish cooling. Run a thin bladed spatula or cake knife around the edge of the pan to help them release easily.

## Notes
Pan Sizes and Approximate Baking Times 
You can bake this as four mini loaves (perfect for gifting, or to freeze some for later), one large standard loaf pan, or in cupcake tins. Butter and flour your pans (if they’re nonstick, you can spray them with pan spray). Bake cupcakes about 15 minutes, mini loaves 20-25 minutes, and 35-45 minutes for a loaf pan, or until the tops are domed and a skewer inserted in the cracks in the center comes out clean.
