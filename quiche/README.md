# Quiche
Open Source Emmental and Gruyère Quiche: OSEAGQ


## Description
### Definition
From the definition of the `@gitjonez` unabridged dictionary:

- `quiche,  n.` - Organized, cheesy, scrambled eggs pie

## Ingredients
- 1 Pie dish
- 1 Pie crust (prepared in pie dish)
- 6 Ounces Emmentaler 
- 6 Ounces Gruère 
- 6 Large Eggs*
- 1/3 Cup Whole Milk or Half and Half
- tsp Salt (kosher/flake) 
- 1 Bunch Parsely (extra small bunch, or 1/4 American sized bunch) 
- 1/4 tsp Black Pepper

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 ºF 
1. Grate cheeses
1. Chop parsley
1. Beat eggs
1. Fill pie crust: 
  Layer/mix parsely, cheese, a turn of the pepper grinder.  
  Filling should be almost to the rim, 3/4 to 4/5-ish.
  Floaty stuff should be near the bottom – it may all float 
  to the top
1. Bake, on center rack for approximately 40-50 minutes. 
Do not over cook. If you jiggle the rack or pan, there should
be no "sloshing" of the filling.  Once the sloshing stops
and it's firm-ish to the center, turn off the heat
immediately. If any doubt, leave in the (heat turned off) 
oven for 10 more minutes.
1. Remove and set on heat safe surface (not the stove), for 20-30 minutes
1. Add another turn of pepper and splash of parsely, wait another 20-30 minutes. 
1. Serve and enjoy!
