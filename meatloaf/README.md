# Meatloaf
Yield

## Ingredients
- 2 lbs ground beef, 85% or 80% lean
- 1 med onion, (1 cup), finely chopped
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 2 large eggs
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 Tbsp ketchup
- 3 Tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 3/4 cup Panko breadcrumbs, or gluten-free bread crumbs
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 tsp salt, or to taste
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

### Sauce/glaze
- 3/4 cup ketchup
- 1 ½ tsp white vinegar
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder


## Procedure
1. **Prep** – Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or foil for easier
cleanup, and preheat oven to 350°F.
1. **Sautee** Onion -in a bit of oil over medium heat for 5-7
minutes, stirring occasionally until softened and golden.
Transfer it to a plate and set aside to cool slightly.
1. **Make the Meatloaf Mixture** – In a large bowl, add all of the
meatloaf ingredients and mix just until well combined (your hands
are your best tool for mixing – put on disposable gloves if you
want to).
1. **Shape Meatloaf and Bake** – Add meat to the pan and shape it
into a meatloaf about 8 inches long, 4 inches wide and 3 inches
tall. Bake uncovered at 350˚F for 40 minutes.
1. **Make the Meatloaf Glaze** – In a small bowl, mix all of the
ingredients together for the sauce until combined. 
1. **Spread the sauce** over the Meatloaf, then return to the oven
and bake an additional 20 minutes or until the internal
temperature is 160˚F on an instant-read thermometer. Rest the
meatloaf for 10-15 minutes before serving, and it will be much
easier to slice.
