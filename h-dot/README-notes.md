For a 9 inch quiche I use the following pastry:

8 oz plain (all purpose) flour
5.5 oz cold butter in small cubes
1 large egg
Pinch of table (fine) salt
Water to mix

I pulse the flour, salt and cold cubed butter in the processor until it looks like breadcrumbs then tip into a bowl and slowly add the egg plus a small amount of water to make a dough that is pliable but not wet. This makes a very rich pastry which is good for savoury pies and quiche.

For a pie crust - I.e just the top sitting on the filling: for a large individual pie to serve 4 -

10 oz flour, if you can get self-raising flour I use 5 oz all purpose flour and 5oz self-raising
3oz lard - not sure if you get that in the US, I can’t in France
20z butter
(Or 5 oz butter, but the lard pastry is better if you can get it)
Cold water to mix

Same methodology as above.

I can’t hand make pastry as I am naturally warm and my hands are too hot. 
Pinch fine salt

I’m glad you thin the egg mixture with milk or water, it makes the filling softer.

For mince pies:

I make mince meat using orange zest as I cannot stand candied peel 🤢. I follow this through with the orange pastry which is really nice.

For quiche I often make grated courgette, which is put in raw but squeezed tightly in a tea towel to get rid of the water, and goats cheese.

Like I said before fresh salmon, a small amount of smoked salmon and cooked and squeezed out spinach is good.
