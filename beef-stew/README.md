- 6 cups beef broth
- ½ cup red wine (optional)
- 1 pound potatoes peeled and cubed
- 4 carrots cut into 1 inch pieces
- 4 ribs celery sliced
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste (optional)

- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary or 1 sprig fresh
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch or as needed
- 2 tablespoons water or as needed
- ¾ cup peas

## Directions
### Slow-cooker/crock-pot method
1. I used a cheap hunk of beef which I found in the butcher section:
bottom round – thus the slow-cooker. Trim fat and cube.

1. Cook/render fat. Remove solids. Carefully set beef fat aside.
This makes a great fat for frying the meat as well as the onions, celery.

1. [Optionally] toss beef cubes with flour/salt/pepper mixture and cook on high
heat in beef fat.  Move beef and juices to slow cooker and turn slow cooker on
to low.  Preserve beef fat for subsequent frying, if possible. 

1. Add beef broth and red wine and 1/4 tst salt, to cooker

1. [Optionally] fry over high heat, the chopped onions in a small amount beef
fat or veg oil.  Add to cooker. Repeat for celery. If you need more oil/fat to 
fry in, add a a minimal amount of vegetable oil. You may skip all this frying
but browning will add good flavor, and speed things up a little. 

1. Gently and quickly fry shallots and garlic in fat/oil and add to cooker

1. For best results, give beef, onion, celery, shallot, broth, ... whatever
is in the cooker a two hour head start, especially if using a lower 
quality cut of beef

1. Chop carrots add potatoes add to cooker with parsley and rosemary

1. Add peas to cooker.

1. Simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Depending on cut of beef,
temperature, size of beef and vegetable bit, and speed of the slow-cooker,
you may desire to cook longer for all the ingredients to be cooked to your
liking. Feel free to simmer longer or overnight. Make sure the heat is on
low. 

1. Retrieve sprig of rosemary from cooker and discard

1. Optional: If there is any oil on the top of the stew, a great way to
preserve this flavor and to incoporate back in with a roux: Skim oil only,
from the stew and transfer to a small skillet. Gently, and carefully, boil 
off any water which found its way to the skillet. Add equal part of flour
by volume and whisk together into a paste and cook flour for about 3 minutes.
Add this to the cooker for flavor and thickener. 

1. To increase thickness, in a glass, mix 1 Tbsp corn starch with 1 tsp cold
water. Stir corn starch slurry into the stew. After about 5 minutes, evaluate,
and repeat until the thickness is to your liking. Pro tip: err on the side
of slighly too thin rather than slighly too thick. The stew will get thicker
as it cools. If it's too thick you can add a little water or broth back in. 

1. Serve with a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley or use as pie filling
