# Pie Crust
Yield: 2 crusts*

\*Pie plates, tins, vessles vary in diameter and height. Your milage may vary

## Description
A very basic pie crust recipe.  I've
used this recipe for berry pie and many quiches. 
There are *many, many* variants which you may want to
consult.  I would use these quantities to make one pie 
to start with. 

\*For a sweet pie half the salt. With lightly salted butter, I half the salt. You still probably want a pinch or two of salt
for a sweet, unsalted butter crust. 

## Ingredients
- 2 1/2 Cups All-Purpose Flour
- 2 Tbsp Sugar*
- 1 tsp Salt (kosher/flake)*
- 20 Tbsp Cold Kerrygold (10 Oz)
- 6 Tbsp Ice cold water

## Directions
Work quickly (and carefully), so the butter remains
cool – minimal mixing when incorporating the
cold butter. Over mixing, rolling, manipulating
will result in stretchy, chewy crust – we're going for tender
and flaky. If it's warm in the kitchen, pre-cool the flour and 
bowl in the fridge for at least an hour and place an ice cube
or two in the water. Err on the side of more butter, less flour.

1. Add the flour, salt*, sugar*, to a food processor with 
a chopping blade attachment, add the lid and,
pulse 3-4 times to combine 
1. Chop the butter into 1/2 inch squares and evenly place over
the flour mixture in the food processor 
1. Replace the top and pulse about once per second until the 
chunks of butter are smaller than a grain of rice.  About 10-20
times – it might not resemble dough yet
1. Remove the plunger and while holding down the pulse button 
pour in the water over a 3-4 second pulse
1. Replace the plunger and resume one pulse per second 5-10 pulses
until things start to clump up slightly 
1. Remove the lid and without contacting the blade you should
be able squish the mixture into into a clump. If it's not
holding together at all, try another 2-3 Tbsp ice cold water,
as above
